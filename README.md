# Alice
Send the contnents of a file in a chat, one line per message

Alice requires an original.txt file on the directory you're running it from.

Alice will read the file and then type it (a line followed by an enter, then the next line).

This way you can send the file contnent on a chat, for example, each line on a message.

You can also tell Alice to wait some time between a line and the other.

The first line will be written 10 seconds after you run Alice and tell the time between a line and the other, this way you have time to select the place where you want to input your text.


The "Alice" name was just the 1st name I found in Google
